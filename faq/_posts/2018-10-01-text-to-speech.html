<div>
<h3>After selecting a word, sentence, or paragraph and selecting <code>Speak</code>, why does it not keep reading?</h3>
<p>This is by design, as <code>Speak</code> is most commonly used to hear the pronunciation of a single word or sentence.</p>
<p>To enable text-to-speech to run continously:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the <code>Control</code> icon (looks like a gear wheel)</li>
<li>Scroll down and tap <code>Speech Synthesis (text-to-speech)</code></li>
<li>Toggle <code>Speak all</code> on</li>
</ol>
<p>Once started, speech will now continue until the end of the book or it is stopped by the user.</p>
