<div>
	<p>KyBook synchronizes of the books metadata (a read position, bookmarks, notes, etc) via <strong>iCloud</strong>.</p>
	<p>1. Please make sure that you have connected to an  <strong>iCloud</strong> account. For this: On the Home screen, launch Settings, tap <strong>iCloud</strong>, and enter your Apple ID. Turn iCloud Drive on. If you don't have an <strong>iCloud</strong>, account, tap Create a new Apple ID.
	<p>2. Verify  the application settings -> 'Synchronization' that <strong>iCloud</strong> is enabled.</p>
	<p>By default, synchronization of the books metadata is performed only for the books в <strong>iCloud</strong> and other Cloud Storage (Dropbox, Yandex Disk, etc). You can change the default settings and enable the synchronization for the books on the device by selecting the setting <em>'Synchronize metadata for books on the device'</em>.</p>
	<p>When you first enable the synchronization, it may require a lot of time (It depends on how busy Apple servers). Cloud should create appropriate records on their servers and need time to these records become available on all your devices. Later the synchronization will occur fairly quick. if you allow the application to send you push notifications this will significantly speed up the synchronization process and make it much more stable. If automatic synchronization of the bookmarks, notes, etc did not occur for any reason, you can force synchronization of the book metadata by selecting a menu item ‘Synchronize' in the footer menu <strong>(⌘)</strong>.
