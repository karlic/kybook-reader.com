title: What to do if migrating from KyBook 2 fails
---
<div>
<h3>What can I do if migrating from KyBook 2 fails?</h3>
<p>Firstly, try running migration again. <em>Only those books that do not exist in KyBook 3 are transferred from KyBook 2.</em></p>
<p>Apple's PDF engine used by KyBook 3 may not handle badly-formed or corrupt PDFs, causing migration to fail. If you can identify the PDF causing the failure, you could try moving it to cloud storage before retrying migration.</p>
<p>If all else fails, use cloud storage to transfer books:</p>
<ol>
<li>In KyBook <b><i>2</b></i> copy your books to your preferred storage</li>
<li>In KyBook <b><i>3</b></i> attach this storage.</li>
  <li>In <code>Cataloguer</code> tap the <code>Command</code> icon (top-right of the screen)</li>
<li>Tap <code>Add books</code> on the menu</li>
<li>Tap the line with your preferred storage.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Note: using cloud storage transfer rather than migration will <b>NOT</b> transfer your notes/bookmarsk/etc. from KyBook 2.</h3>
