<p>First go to <code>Control/Bookshelf</code>Screen <em>(on the iPhone look under the <code>More</code> tab)</em> and toggle on the <code>Search bar</code> switch.</p>
<p>After that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the iPad bookshelf (or any of those under Cataloguer)</li>
<li>In the middle of the screen, swipe downwards with one finger</li>
<li>A search box appears</li>
<li>Type in the <b>phrase</b> you wish to search for</li>
<li>The phrase is searched for (insensitively) in the Title, Authors, and Subjects fields</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note that the search is for an exact string, not the individual words in the string.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that you can also view books categorized by their metadata in the <code>Cataloguer</code> screen.</p>
