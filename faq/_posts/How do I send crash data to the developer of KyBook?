<h1>How do I send crash data to the developer of KyBook?</h1>
<p>Crash data is sent automatically by Apple, <b>if you have enabled sharing analytics</b>.</p>

To enable sharing analytics on iPad/iPhone iOS 11.3.1, in the Settings app:
<ol>
<li>Select <code>Privacy</code></li>
<li>Enable <code>Share iPad Analytics</code></li>
<li>Enable <code>Share With App Developers</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Enabling anayltics on other versions of iOS is very similar, but for more details see: [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202100](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202100)</p>
