<h3>What are Collections in KyBook 3 and how are they used?</h3>
<div>
<p>Collections are like Tags, but in addition to books, they can also include categories from the Cataloguer (such as subjects, authors, series) and folders.</p>
<br>
<p>Please note, that I am still unsure about the usefulness and future of Collections. The feature is very much experimental and I may remove it in the future.</p>
