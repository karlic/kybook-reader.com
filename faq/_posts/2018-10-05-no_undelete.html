<h3>Can I get back (undelete) books I deleted from KyBook 3?</h3>
<p>Probably not. iPhones and iPads do not have a Trash can like Macs or Windows and Linux PCs, so there is nowhere to undelete from.</p>
<p>This means that once deleted from the device, books are irrecoverable, which is why KyBook 3 always asks you to confirm before deleting books.</p>
<p>It is <em>possible</em> that the book files could be restored if they were in cloud storage rather than on the device itself. Please check with your cloud storage provider.</p>
