<h3>When opening a book from cloud storage such as Google Drive, does KyBook 3 stream or download the book to local storage?</h3>
<div>
<p>I should like to stream books directly from the cloud without downloading the whole library onto my phone.</p>
<p>KyBook 3 currently only streams audio books from cloud storage.</p
<p>It is <b>possible</b> that PDF and DjVu book formats will be streamable in a future release.</p>
