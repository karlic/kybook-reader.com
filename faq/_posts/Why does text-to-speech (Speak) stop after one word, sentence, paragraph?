<h3>Why does text-to-speech (<code>Speak</code>) stop reading after one word, sentence, or paragraph?</h3>
<p>This is designed behaviour as most people use this feature to hear the pronunciation of a single word, sentence, etc.</p>
<p>If you would prefer text-to-speach to work continuously, after starting it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the <code>Control</code> icon (looks like a gear wheel)</li>
<li>Scroll down to <code>Speech Synthesis (text-to-speech)</code></li>
<li>Tap the <code>Speak all</code> toggle to enable continous speaking.</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking will then continue until the end of the current book.</p>
