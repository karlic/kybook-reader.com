<p>First go to <code>Control/Bookshelf</code>screen <em>(on the iPhone look under <code>More</code> tab)</em> and toggle on the <code>Advanced interface</code> switch.</p>
<p>After that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the <code>Search</code> icon on the <code>Library</code> (home) screen</li>
<li>Tap the <code>Preferences</code> icon in the top right-hand corner (looks like three small sliders)</li>
<li>Select or deselect your match criteria</li>
<li>Type in the text you wish to search for.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the search is case insensitive.</p>
<p>Remember that you can also sort books by their metadata in bookshelves and view books categorized by their metadata in the <code>Cataloguer</code> screen.
